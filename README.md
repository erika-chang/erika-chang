## 📂 Projects

Here are a few projects I’ve been working on — more coming soon!

### 👵 Job Security Dashboard: Retirement Patterns
**Data analysis | Retirement patterns**

This project explores retirement patterns among public employees in Brazil, aiming to analyze trends and create an interactive dashboard to visualize insights on retirement.

🧪 Python, Pandas, matplotlib

📍 https://github.com/erika-chang/retirement-dashboard-brazil

### 👁️ Eyesense: eye disease prediction
**ML | Deep Learning | Disease prevention**

This project aims to predict eye diseases using datasets from the [Kaggle Ocular Disease Recognition (ODIR-5K) Challenge] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k/data). The model is trained on fundus images to identify various eye conditions through AI-driven analysis.[Kaggle challenge].

🧪 Python, scikit-learn, Tensorflow/Keras, matplotlib, GCloud, streamlit
